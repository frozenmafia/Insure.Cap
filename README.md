# Insur.Cap
Redefining insurance. One image at a time.
Insur.Cap transforms risk management through algorithmically driven augmented underwriting, employing AI and computer vision with image-caption fusion for comprehensive coverage, resolving limitations in traditional insurance processes.

Our platform streamlines processes predicts risks proactively and fosters accessible communication through chatbot-based conversation flow.

THE DATA PROBLEM
Incumbent doesn’t have the “touch point” capability  of dataset, to ingest the customer lifestyle data point.

Ok, IoT & wearables might help insurers, but are too costly and still only deterministic through transactional data.

SOLUTION
Insur.Cap transforms risk management through algorithmically driven augmented underwriting, employing AI and computer vision with image-caption fusion for comprehensive coverage, resolving limitations in traditional insurance processes.

Our platform streamlines LAMs processes, predicts risks proactively, and fosters accessible communication through chatbot-based conversation flow.

# Algorithmically driven augmented underwriting

Our platform architecture streamlines LAMs {Large Action/Agentic Model} orchestration processes, predicts risks proactively, and fosters accessible communication (touch point) through chatbot-based UI conversation flow. Multi-modal orchestration for customer UI delivers more/new datasets and data points for augmenting underwriting. The LAM {Large Action/Agentic Model} empower algorithmically driven architecture and process flow decision tree.
